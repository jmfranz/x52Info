# X52-Pro MFD Infomation Screen

For those who got a X52-Pro like me but do not know what to do with the MFD. 

My first attempt to create something for the MFD. It gatters information from the system and the Speedfan App.

One should fix the indicies in the python code (maybe args in the future) to the ones indicated in the Speedfan app in one's computer.

The MFD wrapper I am using is from TradeDangerous code found here: https://bitbucket.org/kfsone/tradedangerous
